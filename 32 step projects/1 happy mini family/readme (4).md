# # The 'Happy Family' mini-project keeps striking!

The idea of the project is to describe the structure of a family while taking into account that every human has relatives and the family members can change over time.

# Working with collection
## The task:

Improve the project: replace all the arrays with collections

#### Techniqual requirements
-  `Pet`, `Human`, `Family` classes must include collections instead of arrays. 
  - `habits` of the `Pet` class should be stored in the `Set` interface.
  - `schedule` of the `Human` class should be stored in the  `Map` interface.
  - `children` (list of children) of the `Family` class should be stored in the `List` interface.
  - A family can now have multiple pets - they should be stored in the `Set` interface.
- Fix the unit-tests.
